            "That number, I'll just take a photo and send it over then, okay? Just email it a little bit cleaner. No problem. I'll be reaching out to you. Do you guys have some background music on over there? We do. I just heard something sound familiar in the background. Yeah, yeah, we like to have a fun vibe around here. We're a fun store. Okay, yeah, yeah, fun store, fun background, fun, fun, fun streams. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun cars. Watch this, boom. Deals, boom. Look at that. Whoa, look at that transition. A Nissan Frontier Pro 4X, but this one has a very particular. I gotta protect my pipes, guys. Okay, we're gonna call on this Nissan Frontier. So we are looking for a Frontier, but we are looking for a very particular Frontier. Now with this Frontier, we are looking for new. The client ideally wants a 2026. Tactical green is their number one color, so we're gonna start there. They are looking for a Pro 4X, but they want the long bed. They do want the convenience package. Frontier, long bed, crew cab. Must-haves, heated seat, heated steering wheel, remote start, premium power. We must have a premium package. See, this is why we look at, this is why we look everything up. Power package, premium package, 3,000 bucks, boom. Arizona, here we come. Now, my goal to get off this car is gonna be $5,500 plus rebate. Let's go crazy. Let's go crazy, $5,500 plus rebate. Let's go. Good afternoon. Nissan, how can I assist? Hey, I just wanted to see if you guys have a car in stock. Yeah, I'd be happy to check on that for you. Give me one second. My name is Michael. My name is Tom. Tom, nice to meet you. What car is it? Do you have a stock number? Yes, I do. It's M as in Mary, N as in Nancy, I as in Ivan. 260140. Let me see. What kind of car is it? It is a Tactical Green Pro 4X. Tactical green. Well, I'm looking at that up. Is it something specific about that car or just the color? I liked it all. The color, the long bed. Oh, it's a long bed? Yeah, I'm a long bed type of guy. That is not a long bed, it's a standard bed. Let me pull up the window circuit just to make sure. Whoa. Yeah, that is a standard, but I do have a long wheelbase in stock and you have to put an orange. Oh, I pushed the wrong button. That's on me. You have one in orange? No, I don't want an orange. That's my fault. I'm just a dumb, dumb McGee. So I'm going to hang up the phone and act like this never happened, okay? I can probably find you one, Tom. No, I already see there's three in California. I'm going to call those here next. Gotcha. All right, well, thanks for giving me a call. No problem, bye. I unchecked the box. I unchecked the box. My fault. I'm going to call this dealership. How can I help? Hey, thank you so much for picking up the phone. My name is Tommy. I just wanted to see if you guys have a car in stock. Yeah, of course. I'm ready for you, man. Awesome. Thank you so much. I have a stock number. It is T as in Tom, N as in Nancy, 630-829. Is it a used car or no? Oh, it's a new car. Sorry. Thank you for even asking. What model is this car? It's a Nissan Frontier. It's a tactical green. Tactical green, okay. I'm sure I don't have a lot of green. So is that the Pro-X or no? It is the Pro-4X. Thank you for asking. Okay, so you're looking at the 0829. That's the one you're looking for, the 52-220 MSRP? Thank you so much. That's it. Okay. How can I help you on this truck? You know what? I've already driven one. I already know I want it. I'm really just trying to get some great pricing. Where are you calling from, if you don't mind me asking? My name is Jay. My name is Tommy. Thank you for asking. I'm in ******. Where is that? How close or how far are you away from ******? I mean, not too far. I mean, it's like a $60 plane ticket, but like a few hours away. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. Thanks for my concern. Yeah. That's why I'm asking these funny questions, because we don't do out-of-state unless you come by and pick it up if the deal works out. Oh, you know, I'm willing to pick it up. Thank you for double-checking, though. I'm not wasting my time. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. That's so kind of you. So, I mean, the price is already pretty, you know, transparent. It's up front, you know, on the internet. You know, daily discount. There's a customer cash. That brings us down to 48,720 before the fees and whatnot. You know, taxes, whatever. It's the zip code you want to register. So, you know, I'm willing to pick it up. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. And you guys don't have any, like, dealer add-ons or anything crazy? Thank you. We do. You sound like a broker. Are you a broker? I'm not a broker. Okay.  to be honest with you, so there's like a car RX, especially on these higher end that we have out here, like the 50 grand or 40 something. It has the anti-car theft in there, it has the paint protection already in there, and it has the door edges in there, which is the thing, it's like a three mm clear film bar that they install all around the door corners, so when customers, when we open the doors, every day it won't scratch or chip out the paint. So yeah, and how much is all that? All that stuff, it's about, so the car deck is about like 13 or 12.50, and then the paint protection, it's like 9.98 if I'm not wrong, or 9.50, and then the door edges, which every single dealer, all this stuff, every single dealer has it in California. The door edges, I think 2.99 for all the four doors, so when you open it, it just won't chip your paint. So you guys are kind of above MSRP on the car. I know you said it's super transparent on the website, but not really that transparent, because all that wasn't on there. Well, I'll be honest with you, there is no dealerships out there like a Nissan or Toyota, Honda, they're gonna put all those hard add-ons on the vehicles. So you're saying every dealership says that the pricing is super transparent on the website and it has ads? Yeah, you can call Toyota dealers, call a couple Toyota dealers if you want a Honda. I promise you, they are gonna have these hard add-ons in there, it's common things in all the dealerships. I can't control how they run it, but that's like a very state-wise here at least. So it's like saying you're transparent, and then unless somebody calls it out, then no harm, no foul, right? I'm just a salesperson. If you don't ask for something, otherwise I usually bring it up anyway before they move further with me, I just don't like to get people get upset. Good thing we're only like four minutes and 15 seconds into the call, I hope that's okay for you. Not too much time that I wasted from you. Yeah, no, I mean, like I said, I know I asked the question when you said it's transparent pricing, and kind of like when I asked what the pricing is in the car, and you said, well, it's transparent on the website, and you didn't mention it that way, like that would have been your moment to mention it. Gotcha, okay, so I'm sure you're calling around, and you're not just the only Nissan here that you're looking to get a Pro-4X, is there something that you're looking for that maybe can get to the point faster for you? Yeah, I mean, I already have a deal for $1,000 off at. and feel that that was good of a deal. I understand you're saying these are super hard and rare cars, but it's a Nissan? Like, I mean, transparently, it's one of the reasons. I could buy a Tacoma, right? I could go buy a Ridgeline. Those are hard, these are difficult cars. Those are demand cars. A Frontier, right now, Nissan's on the best spot, right? It's fine, I want it, but not like it's a car that everybody's looking for that you guys are probably slammed every single day with everybody buying Nissan. I completely agree with you, and I get it, but I think we can both agree that the pricing-wise, better than a Toyota. The car itself with the NA natural big block, for the moment, it's better than the little four-cylinder that has a bunch of recalls already. Now, my price is $48,720. Let me go do this for you real quick, is I wanna make sure the truck is still here, it's not contracted or been dealt or traded to somebody else or just a store. That's the first thing I gotta do. Second is, I'll go ahead and get the pricing for you. I'll have all that printed out. I'll send it to you, to your cell phone number. We'll work from there. Also, just so you know, for preview than other clients, like a V6 is not a big block, right? It's a six-cylinder. You can say it's a six-cylinder. It's not a big block. Yeah, it's not a big block. That's a whole different engine, right? If you have a big block in there, maybe that is worth the above markup and why you guys have such a crazy fee on it, but like, it's a six-cylinder. I mean, again, I want it and I like it, but it's not a big block. Well, what I meant is a big V6, you know, that's what I meant. So, you know, my price is $48,720, and I'm assuming, like I said, I'm not the only Nissan you're calling, right? So, I mean, what's the best? If you have a better price than my In-N-S-L price already, let's just exclude me. Of MSRP, you're the worst price of the day, but I've only called one other dealership, so it's not like I've called a lot of dealerships. $1,000 off MSRP plus rebate. Okay, and then that's what they offer you, same as mine, basically, almost, right? No, incorrect, because you guys have through a little over almost three grand of rebates, or $2,500 of ads. You're offering $1,000, and then you're adding $2,500 back, and the idea that every dealership is doing that is not correct. So, did that dealership also have these thing on, or you're saying that they didn't have these thing on? Nope, surprisingly, not every dealership does it. So, okay, as long as they're being transparent with you, they're not gonna do the bait and switch, when you go there and drive in. No, you're just incorrect by saying that all dealerships do it. do and you know in California it's more common than others but not every dealership does it. So let me do this for you you know I can go ahead and talk to my boss assuming the price and everything works out you are going to drive out and drive it back to your home and it's not going to be something shipped out of state to you right? Yeah I mean I'm more than willing to drive it if it makes sense yeah absolutely if the deal makes sense. And uh Tommy right is that what you said? Correct. Okay Tommy give me about 15-30 minutes hopefully I have something you know better number for you than than the 48, 720 plus excluding some of those hard add-ons okay? Thank you so much I appreciate it. All right man take care I'll text you right now with my number that way when I come back with the number it'll be more accurate with the tax rate right? All right sounds good. Okay one moment here just let me text before weighing up so you know you got my number and I can go ahead and work for you. All right sounds good. Good talking to you Tommy take care. Good talking to you bye. We just don't have to like lie right? Like it's like super simple if you have ads own your ads this is like the problem and it's like the from but it's like the gaslighting of like hey this is it's so fool I get so mad because it's this gaslighting right it's the idea where I'm like oh what's the price online can you guys give me the I'm looking for a good pricing well the pricing online is pretty transparent right there it's on there so so 48, 720. Um so are there ads? Oh yeah of course there's ads every dealership does that like what are we doing every dealership does it so why would I bring and I would have brought it I promise you I would have brought it up later just like the Honda guy it was a joke I promise it was a joke it was a joke it's a Nissan it's a Nissan oh my it's a neat and I'm sorry I don't care who you think you are the pro 4x is not a magically crazy car that nobody can get if you guys don't know who I am hi nice to meet you my name is Tommy I negotiate car deals for a living my goal is to save you time energy and anxiety we save you money but that's a byproduct I charge a flat fee of a thousand bucks I handle everything for you the price of the car the trade the add-ons the accessories you sit back relax I do everything I don't advertise this as a money saving service because guess what I'm going to give some truth to you some knowledge to you some information in your noggin you didn't know you can do this yourself you don't need to hire me I don't I don't got a magic wand. I don't got a secret sauce that saves you thousands of dollars more than you can on your own. Realistically, you're gonna spend more money doing it because just the thousand dollar fee alone. Now we get great deals on cars. Our clients are super happy with our experience. With that being said, I teach everything I do online. So if you wanna do this yourself, by all means. But my service is similar to hiring a CPA, hiring a lawyer, going out to eat, or hiring somebody to clean your house or mow your lawn. People wanna save time, energy, and anxiety. If you're like, hey Tommy, I got questions for ya. Like, how many fingers are you holding up? I don't know.

And I personally answer every single email. I get 50 to 80 emails a day. And every night, I sit down, I sit down, and I answer all of them. Hello? Thank you for calling my son's name's Carl. How can I help you? Hey, I just wanted to see if you guys have a car in stock. Oh, quite possibly. New car, pre-owned car? It is a brand new car, new 2026. Oh, okay. Do you have the stock number or VIN number? I do, it's 829-930. Yeah, that vehicle is available. What intrigued you the most about this particular car? Everything. Green, it has everything I want. Perfect build, it's simple, it's easy, it's everything I want. Yeah, are you familiar with the Frontier? I am, I've driven one, I already know I want it, want more of it. Right on, when would you like to schedule a time to come and take a look at it? You know what, I've already, like I said, I've already driven it, already know I want it, really just trying to get the best pricing on it, and if I like the pricing, I'll buy it today. That's fair. And how are you trying to buy it? Are you trying to lease it, purchase it, pay cash? The low APR financing. Okay, perfect. All right, what's your name? Tommy. Last name? Mikula, M-I-K-U-L-A. All right, and what part of town is the vehicle gonna be registered in? Oh, I'm actually in Arizona. Okay. So Arizona town. Are you going to truck it back or drive it back? I would truck it back to avoid your sales tax. I don't know. Okay, that's a long shipping, and you're gonna have a bill of lading to do that? Yeah, yeah, I should. of cars before, but yeah, it's not too bad. Okay, I will start working on this. I'm gonna send you a text message here in about 10 seconds. If you reply back the word yes to that text, it'll allow me to be able to text you over the numbers. That way you actually have them in writing. Is that fair? That'd be great. Awesome, thank you so much, Tommy. Are there any other questions I can answer while I have you on the phone? Nope, that's all. Excellent, thank you again. Yeah, I mean, I just, I mean, it's just like small things, which that wasn't like, it's not a hard, it's a six hour drive. It's not a crazy far distance. I'm one state over. Like I even like looked it up, cause I'm like, did I make a mistake? As soon as an MSRP of 52,000. I guess what the next dealership I look at is offering 3167 off. That's a better start. Thank you for calling Nissan. This is Kim. Hey Kim, I just wanted to talk to New Car Sales. Okay, were you trying to purchase a new car? Yes, if you don't mind. Yeah, of course. Give me one sec.

Okay, sounds good. All right, thank you. I'll call you right back, Tom. All right, bye. Okay, so as of right now we are looking for his number one color his number one color is a little bit harder to get So I'm looking all around the nation for it So one of the things that a lot of clients just don't do is look like nationwide for a car like that can help out A ton so some markets cars can be more or easier to get than others So that's always step one for us is always look and see can we find it in a better market elsewhere? And this is like part of the advantage of using delivered right like now everybody wants to go nationwide to find a car Hi, Tommy. It's Karl. Oh, I just realized that you sent me a text message while I was dialing you I apologize Oh, I was calling to make sure you got the numbers and see what questions you had on the on the numbers I mean, that's where I'm at. You're cold. We're really close though. I appreciate you guys being great. This is great so far We get to 5k. I think we got a deal 5k is pretty steep If you choose standard financing or to provide your own financing, there's a $2,500 rebate that's available If you add that I'm way over $5,000 and concessions. Yeah, I'm looking at a 1.9. I appreciate it I know I know it's a steep deal. I appreciate that. I've been looking around I think I can find it, but I prefer to do it with you guys as you guys know six-hour drive So it's a fair request I'll be more than happy to take your offer to the executive manager, but I personally can't say 5,000 off How close to the? 3637 that I'm off. Can we agree to or is it 5,000 or nothing? I mean, I'd like to be a 5k You know ideally that's where I want to be at if you gave me forty eight hundred dollars off You know, I twist my elbow call today. Okay. Well, I like I said, I'll definitely take that to my em And you had mentioned earlier on the phone that this is something we could probably do today But that was before I found out you're what I have to FedEx the information out or would you drive out here? To set up shipment. What were your plans on the logistics? Yes for me my business partner realistically we could ship it We could do FedEx if you guys have a sign never makes the most sense. We can figure that out I mean, what I couldn't get the ball rolling put the deposit down whatever needs to make you feel like you're more serious and all That fun stuff, but we'll figure out the logistics. I mean we could technically drive but that might be a little bit crazy Okay, and Tommy just so Want to make sure that we know that we're on the right truck. You know, this is a long bed Pro 4x, correct? I do I do I do know it's a long bed. I appreciate it. I appreciate you double-checking. Yeah, no worries It's a pretty rare truck and I just wanted to make sure that you knew it was a long bed Sometimes people don't catch that when they're looking on the website. Okay, I appreciate that. All right, no worries. I will Like I said, I'll pass this information on I do believe he's in a meeting right now But as soon as I have a word in either direction, I will let you know. Okay. Thank you so much No worries.

It's a brand new new 2026 Nissan Frontier Pro 4x Is it the long bear the green one? Yeah, the long bed the LWB. Yes, sir. That is What would you like to come on in? You know what? I'm gonna make your life so easy I've already driven it ready. No, I want it I want more of it really just trying to get some great pricing and the second I get that I will buy your truck You already test drove the truck. You're trying to get a good deal on this then right? Yeah, you know Just like every other consumer, you know, I drove it found it now. I'm just trying to get the best deal I heard Nissan are doing some credible deals. I'm looking for it. Perfect All right Then look the best way for you get the best deal is honestly you coming in store once you're in here I can go ahead and bet for you talk to my managers and let's see what we can do I like a plan. Uh, you know, I prefer to do everything over the phone. Call me crazy I just saw a tick-tock today of a girl that came in and heard the same thing and she ended up getting harassed about going On a date with the guy to get numbers and that was what the presence meant So, you know, I'm just avoiding it all together. I'll just stay at home. You know, I don't want to go I'm happily engaged. So I'm trying to avoid that like I'm like, oh, come on, man. Give me a shot, you know Oh, I can't it might be the best man. I appreciate though What's gonna make it by the truck? I mean, where do you want to be? I mean, what's the trade deal? I'm looking right for around like a $4,000 discount plus rebates. So look, right now we are discounting. So you're already getting a $3,000 discount. So on top of that, you want a $4,000 discount. You guys are advertising a $714 discount. So we actually have a 714 plus 2,500 from Nissan Customer Cash. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna, I'm gonna do the low APR financing, which is why I'm trying to get a $4,000 discount. Okay, so you're doing the, Yeah, that's why it's a dealer discount. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, plus rebates. Yeah, plus customer cash. So you're doing the low, the financing promotion then? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like the low APR versus the customer cash. Okay, let me see what they're offering right now. Oh, okay, I see the 1.9 for 60 months. You got it, Captain. Okay, so then you'd want basically, so basically we're giving a $700 discount. Obviously you don't get the 2,500. So we'd be looking at a $33,000. Yeah, I'd be looking for a $4,000 discount. I'd love that line to say four grand. Okay, here, let me see. Let me take your information down. So I can go ahead and present this to my manager and then you'll be, are you gonna be free all day today? Yeah, I'm free. I'm, like I said, I'm trying to buy a car. Perfect, what is your first and last name? First name, Tom, last name, Mick, Tom, M-I-C-K. Perfect, and what's a good phone number? Phone number is gonna be. The best shot for you to get that $4,000 is gonna be in person, but let me just go ahead and bring this up to my manager and then we'll kinda, you'll be hearing from me shortly, okay? Yeah, you can go look at that TikTok thing. It's pretty crazy. So I think a lot of people are not gonna wanna go to dealerships after that. All right, man, no worries, but okay. Give me a couple minutes. You'll hear from me shortly, okay? All right, sounds good. All right, sounds good, man. All right. All right, bye. Don't worry, guys, your presence is your power. We'll get a text back. One second, we'll get a text. Let me see, what's this? Hey, this is Gavin. I found just the last one buried behind all of these, but here it is. I got the keys. You can see the stock number. 26176. Wow. This is this one. Here it is. I'll be reaching out short Giving us can we get to you 5k? I'm gonna call him. I'm gonna call him I'm gonna call his dealership back. He got me 36. Wait, this is Tom. Hey, Tom, it's it out of the Someone's just on the phone. Hey, how's it going? Hey good. So I have a good news. We are able to discount $2,681 plus removing the ads. Sorry plus removing the ads Do you guys not have ads? Am I crazy? Yeah, you don't have ads. I was just messing with I was a test and you passed Honestly, good job Yeah, sorry Woman, okay 2681 and that's all dealer discount with a low APR. That's not the customer cash. No, that's not the customer cash That's on top I mean if you wanted to do he's willing to give you that same discount if you wanted to do the Get the 2,500 reader as well, but you'd be obviously forfeiting the low APR So, but if you want you really want to do the low APR, he's willing to do 2681 off the truck I appreciate that. I appreciate being transparent there. You know, I have a deal for $3,700. I just got a call back on I'm trying to be closer to about five grand off I mean the thing is this the only truck is the only Frontier Pro 4x long bed with both the Convenience package and the premium package. There's not another one in the state So, I mean we're willing to we're willing to discount some money, but we're not gonna discount 4,000 or 5,000. Yeah, I appreciate it But I mean part of it is is that it's a long bed and not everybody's looking for a long bed And it's not like Nissan's making a million of these cars, you know Oh, oh, no, they're not but I mean it's with it being the only one in the state I mean, there's not I mean it we're not gonna discount four thousand five thousand dollars on a vehicle That's the only one in the state and we got a unicorn here, you know, I mean there's other colors, right? You're right. There's no other colors of this one in the state, but there's three other cars I would take and there's others in other states around you It's not it's not a unicorn just because it's I am if I look at Frontiers as a whole you guys have 50 on your Lot, right? It's a long bed like not everybody's looking for a long bed Frontier most people buy a Frontier because it's a small truck idea The long bed is not as died. Nissan doesn't make as many it doesn't mean I'm gonna pay more for it It's also 20 Yes. It is a 1026. I just haven't made a lot of them yet. I mean, you guys, if you guys want to hold on to it and maybe somebody's willing to pay crazy price for it, but I have a feeling in a week or two, you guys would call me back anyway and I've bought a car from somebody else and we're back to square one and you guys are like, dang, Nissan's, the market's rough. Well, I mean, you said you have other offers, right? Yeah. I have a deal for $3,700 off and they were trying to get to 5k. And then is it the same? Is it a different color? Yeah. No, it's the same color. This one is a tactical green and they are at $3,700 off MSRP. Let me pull it over here. And where's this one at? Uh, this one is in, uh, California, uh, 36, 37 off. So then are you going to pay to get the vehicle delivered? Yeah. See, I mean, whatever you're saving there, you're going to spend on, on delivery. So it's like, well, I mean, if they get me to 5k off now, I mean, shipping is going to be like 500 bucks. Well, I mean, if you do, I mean, look, if you have a written offer, I mean, if you can get that over to me, then maybe I can do something a little bit for more for you. Sure. You're already texted. Yeah. You text, text it. Cause I'm calling you off like the landline, which is a landline, so I can't get text messages there. Uh, are you able to, I'll give you my personal number. You can text it to me there. Yeah. That's, um, yeah. If you want to give me your personal number on the world. My system just crashed. Uh, I guess I'll call the guy back. I don't know. I don't remember his name. I honestly thought this was the San Francisco dealership. This is Tom. Hey Tom, it's Gavin at Nissan. How are you? Hey man. How's it going? Good. Good. Hey, did you get that video I sent over of the truck? I did. It looks great. And nobody's driven it. This is the dream in the driveway. If I've ever seen one, you know? So, I mean, you know, anything that we have online advertised with pricing is what we'll is what we'll do. There are some, I'm pulling it up right now. Typically Nissan doesn't do special financing and all the discounts. That's usually one or the other, whichever you prefer. So it looks like the online price is $46,828. Is that the one you saw? That is the one I saw. Okay, cool. So yeah.  So the window sticker on this starts at $52,495. We usually ask like a couple over, but the window sticker is usually 52, it's $52,495. So you will get that discount, 3,116 bucks. I think there is special financing for 1.9 on these things. I'll get the term. So if you do that, we won't get the 2,500 cash, but you'll be making that up in money you save on the principal anyway. Yeah, yeah, and I appreciate that. Do you guys have any dealer add-ons or fees or anything crazy? I actually just did another one of these over the phone with a customer. The dock fees, lender fees, depends on the price of the car. So this will be a good estimate. He put $5,000, so let's say if you put five grand down, sales tax would be around $3,500, between 3,500 and 3,600 bucks. Documentary fee is probably gonna be somewhere like in the low 400s, maybe 420, $430. And then the $289 is the VTR, the vehicle theft registration. It's those little metal stickers that you see inside of the door frames on cars. And what that does is it gives you a little bit of an insurance break. Insurance likes having those on there. Basically, if something happens to your vehicle, heaven forbid, even if it then gets compromised, it can be traced back to you as an owner. And in the event of a total loss, it covers you up to 2,500 bucks. But at $289, yeah, nothing else really is gonna be there. I mean, if you wanna do gap insurance, we can show you what that looks like. So you guys' dock insurance, or your dock fee scales with the price of the car? I need to check on that. That's a novel concept I've never heard before. Well, I've seen it, to be honest, I've seen it come back a little bit lower. So that's why I wanted to check. Normally, I mean, this one here was 423 bucks, but this is a different car. But I mean, other than that, I mean, we're looking at hundreds in the terms of just little fees. Well, I appreciate your transparency, the $300 ad or whatever, that's whatever. I do have a deal already for a bigger discount, though, without that dock fee at $3,600 with an $85 dock fee. So it's almost like a thousand dollar better deal than your dealership right now. What dealership is that? It's ****** and ******. Okay, I mean, that might just be a California thing. I don't know about their... dock fees. What's the selling price on that vehicle? Yeah, the MSRP is $51,960. They're down to $48,323. They're adding an $85 dock fee, a $35 temporary tag fee and an $8.75 tire, battery and VTR. So the out the door is $48,451.75 plus tax. OK. I mean, ours is still is still cheaper. I mean, it sounds like we have a better deal on that one already. Before it was cheaper. Well, you said there's before taxes was $48 something. Yeah, but that's because you guys are adding the $2,500 thing. I'm doing 1.9 percent financing. Oh, I see. OK, so there's at 1 percent at 1.9 percent. It's 48, 48, 3, 2, 3. Yeah. And they're trying to even save me more. So, OK, I mean, we're I mean, we're pretty close to me. What do we need to do to earn your business? I'm trying to be at $4,500 off. So you so what you're telling me, if I could get the customer cash, do you want $4,000 under MSRP at 1.9 percent? Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to be at $4,500 off with the 1.9 percent. That'd be under MSRP. So under forty five hundred dollars off of fifty two thousand four ninety five. Correct. Correct. Well, if I could do that for you, would you want to lock this vehicle in? Yeah. You get a forty five hundred dollars off. It's a great deal. Yeah. And it's your lucky numbers, man. You told my lucky numbers. You're right. And it's it's it's it's still wrapped from Christmas for you. I know nobody's driven it. Nobody's touched it. I love it. Um, if I can do that for you, can you be here today? Yeah. I mean, I want to do all the paperwork. Why we need me to today for sure. OK, let me just get a let me just see if we can do that for you. I mean, we're pretty close already. Let me see what I can do. OK, I'll give you a call. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. No problem. Bye. So there are currently our best offer is the best deal we currently have is forty eight Nissan Frontier. We've gone from above MSRP to below MSRP on this deal. This is Tom. Hey, Tom, it's Gavin. It's now a good time to talk. Gavin, it's a great time to talk. Good. So it's a good time. So lucky number two, six, one, seven, six. My manager said he can do forty five hundred dollars under our MSRP, so forty five hundred dollars under fifty two thousand four ninety five. and he'll do the 1.9% for you. I love it. Send me that down and then send me what you need for me to start the paperwork. Okay. Are you able to come into the dealership? I mean, I prefer to do it all remotely if possible, just being a little bit of a distance, but. How far away are you? I'm in Prescott. You're in where, I'm sorry? Oh, you're in Arizona right now? Yeah. Oh, I misheard you. I thought you said you could come up here today. My bad. I mean, in theory we could come up whenever, but obviously we'll make it work. Okay, perfect. Well, I, here, let me, since I got you on the phone, do you have a few minutes for me to do what I need for a finance application? Well, let me, you know, just call me. Some dealerships are slimy and horrible. I'm not saying you guys are, but some are. If you could just send me that down so I have it in writing and then I'll give you whatever information you need. It's going to be on my business partner's name, but, or maybe both of our, I'll talk to him about it right now, but we're going to do it in one of our names. But if you could just do me a favor and just send it down to writing so I have that, and then we'll give you all the information you need. Yeah, I'll get that structured for you. Were you planning on putting anything down? Is there a trade in? Five to $10,000 down, no trade. Okay. Between five to 10, do you want me to structure it with like 7,500 down? That's in the middle. Just do, yeah. Yeah, you can do it. Yeah, you can just do it. You know, I could probably show you a pencil with three options, depending on the deal. Gavin, I appreciate it. You got my lucky number working. I know, man. I appreciate it. And you know, it's my day off, man. I came in, I got lucky. It's meant to be. Whoa, what are the chances, man? I know, man. I like your energy. This is fun. You know what? My mom always said I had good energy, but my dad, he didn't like it. Maybe he was jealous. Honestly, I don't like them. So, let's see what's going on. Were you guys gonna want to look at any type of like warranty on this? I mean, it would be in theory. I mean, it's something we're considering, but we haven't decided yet. Okay. Well, I'll show you, I'll show you with an extended warranty that takes your three year 36,000 bumper to bumper, basically, which is the wrong term nowadays. These things don't really have bumpers anymore, but that's all your computer's electronics. And that could extend it out to probably like 72 months or a hundred thousand miles, whichever. If you plan on having it for a while, we recommend it, you know, with all the computer diagnosing things, but like after, if you have this thing for four or five years, that stuff won't be covered, you know? And that can be pretty hefty out of pocket stuff. Would you like me to show you with a warranty? Let's just say without for now, just so we have it, and then we'll, we're considering it. But if you want to send me the pricing on it, I'll definitely do it. Yeah, and I am I could I could tell you you know the the coverage in the term just so you can have you have That yeah Okay, perfect and if you guys put between five to ten thousand I don't think you'll need yet, but I'll let my manager will know what to do with that. Okay, okay Sounds good without warranty 1.9 for those six months. Let me get that structured and I'll get your email home I don't use email man. It's the devil's work. I can text you and then I got you you yeah You can text me back to that that number. I'll just take a photo and send it over there. Okay, just email No problem Do you guys have some background music on over there we do I just heard some like something sound familiar in the background Yeah, yeah, we like to like to have a fun vibe around here. We're a fun store. Okay. Yeah Yeah, fun store fun background fun fun fun streams fun fun fun fun fun cars. Okay. Awesome. Great Let me get this together Yeah, and I'll text it. Thanks so much. You're welcome. I'll be in touch. Okay. Bye Yeah, for sure. I was on the back. Gosh, I just want to do it I think we gotta go to Canada guys. They were gonna go to Canada. I just keep getting recognized I'm gonna tell my team call call Michael Hunter sub dog. What's going on? Hey this Frontier Pro 4x took me a little bit longer But I got a long bed and they're willing to do $4,500 off it and the 1.9 Dang with a long bed in the green that he wants bada-boom bada-bing bada-bing Can you can you send it to the client? Let him know that I did this live I want to jump on it ASAP because there's not many of these trucks. This is like a nationwide truck look Yeah, okay cool cool chill cool cool cool, um, that is all I need Let me know if there's any issue there Wait, we got new numbers one second, please hold. Oh, there's other dealerships at $4,400 off so just you guys know this is how this is what dealerships do, right? And I think they may be the guy that was watching us live on the Frontier deal It doesn't matter right, but I want to I want to be very clear. So let's go back to the frontier deal. So we talked about the frontier deal, the dealership went through and took back the offer, they went back and took back the offer and said, Nah, we're not giving you the offer anymore. My manager vetoed it. So we're gonna give it to the other dealership that ended up giving us $4,400 off with the $85 doc fee. Bada boom bada bitch.\n"

            "[00:04:56.220 - 00:04:57.979] SPEAKER_07:  like a Nissan or Toyota, Honda,\n",
            "[00:04:57.979 - 00:05:00.900] SPEAKER_07:  they're gonna put all those hard add-ons on the vehicles.\n",
            "[00:05:00.900 - 00:05:02.580] SPEAKER_05:  So you're saying every dealership\n",
            "[00:05:02.580 - 00:05:04.620] SPEAKER_05:  says that the pricing is super transparent\n",

            "[00:05:10.019 - 00:05:11.980] SPEAKER_07:  I promise you, they are gonna have these hard add-ons\n",
            "[00:05:11.980 - 00:05:13.980] SPEAKER_07:  in there, it's common things in all the dealerships.\n",
            "[00:05:13.980 - 00:05:15.300] SPEAKER_07:  I can't control how they run it,\n",
            "[00:05:15.300 - 00:05:17.980] SPEAKER_07:  but that's like a very state-wise here at least.\n",
            "[00:05:17.980 - 00:05:20.019] SPEAKER_05:  So it's like saying you're transparent,\n",
            "[00:05:20.019 - 00:05:22.459] SPEAKER_05:  and then unless somebody calls it out,\n",
            "[00:05:22.459 - 00:05:24.019] SPEAKER_05:  then no harm, no foul, right?\n",

            "[00:05:26.040 - 00:05:26.879] SPEAKER_07:  If you don't ask for something,\n",
            "[00:05:26.879 - 00:05:28.199] SPEAKER_07:  otherwise I usually bring it up anyway\n",
            "[00:05:28.199 - 00:05:29.480] SPEAKER_07:  before they move further with me,\n",

            "[00:05:46.959 - 00:05:48.879] SPEAKER_05:  like that would have been your moment to mention it.\n",

            "[00:06:29.639 - 00:06:31.879] SPEAKER_07:  for the moment, it's better than the little four-cylinder\n",

            "[00:06:53.799 - 00:06:56.959] SPEAKER_05:  like a V6 is not a big block, right?\n",
            "[00:06:56.959 - 00:06:57.799] SPEAKER_05:  It's a six-cylinder.\n",

            "[00:07:02.680 - 00:07:03.639] SPEAKER_05:  If you have a big block in there,\n",
            "[00:07:03.639 - 00:07:05.720] SPEAKER_05:  maybe that is worth the above markup\n",
            "[00:07:05.720 - 00:07:07.239] SPEAKER_05:  and why you guys have such a crazy fee on it,\n",
            "[00:07:07.239 - 00:07:08.440] SPEAKER_05:  but like, it's a six-cylinder.\n",
            "[00:07:08.440 - 00:07:10.080] SPEAKER_05:  I mean, again, I want it and I like it,\n",

            "[00:03:23.279 - 00:03:31.279] SPEAKER_07:  Thank you for double-checking, though.  I'm not wasting my time.  I appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  That's so kind of you.  So, I mean, the price is already pretty, you know, transparent.  It's up front, you know, on the internet.  You know, daily discount.\n",
            "[00:03:31.279 - 00:03:36.279] SPEAKER_05:  There's a customer cash.  That brings us down to 48,720 before the fees and whatnot.  You know, taxes, whatever.  It's the zip code you want to register.  So, you know, I'm willing to pick it up.\n",
            "[00:03:36.279 - 00:03:40.279] SPEAKER_07:  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:03:50.279 - 00:03:54.000] SPEAKER_05:  And you guys don't have any, like, dealer add-ons or anything crazy?\n",
            "[00:03:54.000 - 00:03:57.000] SPEAKER_07:  Thank you.  We do.  You sound like a broker.\n",
            "[00:03:57.000 - 00:03:58.000] SPEAKER_05:  Are you a broker?\n",
            "[00:03:58.000 - 00:04:00.000] SPEAKER_07:  I'm not a broker.  Okay.\n",
            "[00:04:00.000 - 00:04:00.000] UNKNOWN: \n",
            "[00:04:00.000 - 00:04:22.219] SPEAKER_07:  to be honest with you, so there's like a car RX,  especially on these higher end that we have out here,  like the 50 grand or 40 something.  It has the anti-car theft in there,  it has the paint protection already in there,  and it has the door edges in there,  which is the thing, it's like a three mm clear film bar  that they install all around the door corners,  so when customers, when we open the doors,  every day it won't scratch or chip out the paint.\n",
            "[00:04:22.219 - 00:04:23.500] SPEAKER_05:  So yeah, and how much is all that?\n",
            "[00:04:23.500 - 00:04:44.400] SPEAKER_07:  All that stuff, it's about, so the car deck  is about like 13 or 12.50, and then the paint protection,  it's like 9.98 if I'm not wrong, or 9.50,  and then the door edges, which every single dealer,  all this stuff, every single dealer has it in California.  The door edges, I think 2.99 for all the four doors,  so when you open it, it just won't chip your paint.\n",
            "[00:04:44.400 - 00:04:52.759] SPEAKER_05:  So you guys are kind of above MSRP on the car.  I know you said it's super transparent on the website,  but not really that transparent,  because all that wasn't on there.\n",
            "[00:04:52.759 - 00:05:00.900] SPEAKER_07:  Well, I'll be honest with you,  there is no dealerships out there  like a Nissan or Toyota, Honda,  they're gonna put all those hard add-ons on the vehicles.\n",
            "[00:05:00.900 - 00:05:04.620] SPEAKER_05:  So you're saying every dealership  says that the pricing is super transparent\n",
            "[00:05:04.620 - 00:05:17.980] SPEAKER_07:  on the website and it has ads?  Yeah, you can call Toyota dealers,  call a couple Toyota dealers if you want a Honda.  I promise you, they are gonna have these hard add-ons  in there, it's common things in all the dealerships.  I can't control how they run it,  but that's like a very state-wise here at least.\n",
            "[00:05:17.980 - 00:05:24.019] SPEAKER_05:  So it's like saying you're transparent,  and then unless somebody calls it out,  then no harm, no foul, right?\n",
            "[00:05:24.019 - 00:05:38.680] SPEAKER_07:  I'm just a salesperson.  If you don't ask for something,  otherwise I usually bring it up anyway  before they move further with me,  I just don't like to get people get upset.  Good thing we're only like four minutes  and 15 seconds into the call,  I hope that's okay for you.  Not too much time that I wasted from you.  Yeah, no, I mean, like I said,\n",
            "[00:05:38.680 - 00:05:48.879] SPEAKER_05:  I know I asked the question when you said  it's transparent pricing,  and kind of like when I asked what the pricing is  in the car, and you said,  well, it's transparent on the website,  and you didn't mention it that way,  like that would have been your moment to mention it.\n",
            "[00:05:48.879 - 00:05:57.900] SPEAKER_07:  Gotcha, okay, so I'm sure you're calling around,  and you're not just the only Nissan here  that you're looking to get a Pro-4X,  is there something that you're looking for  that maybe can get to the point faster for you?\n",
            "[00:05:57.900 - 00:06:21.479] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I mean, I already have a deal  for $1,000 off at.  and feel that that was good of a deal.  I understand you're saying these are super hard  and rare cars, but it's a Nissan?  Like, I mean, transparently, it's one of the reasons.  I could buy a Tacoma, right?  I could go buy a Ridgeline.  Those are hard, these are difficult cars.  Those are demand cars.  A Frontier, right now, Nissan's on the best spot, right?  It's fine, I want it, but not like it's a car  that everybody's looking for that you guys  are probably slammed every single day  with everybody buying Nissan.\n",
            "[00:06:21.479 - 00:06:51.680] SPEAKER_07:  I completely agree with you, and I get it,  but I think we can both agree that the pricing-wise,  better than a Toyota.  The car itself with the NA natural big block,  for the moment, it's better than the little four-cylinder  that has a bunch of recalls already.  Now, my price is $48,720.  Let me go do this for you real quick,  is I wanna make sure the truck is still here,  it's not contracted or been dealt or traded  to somebody else or just a store.  That's the first thing I gotta do.  Second is, I'll go ahead and get the pricing for you.  I'll have all that printed out.  I'll send it to you, to your cell phone number.  We'll work from there.\n",
            "[00:06:51.680 - 00:07:11.879] SPEAKER_05:  Also, just so you know, for preview than other clients,  like a V6 is not a big block, right?  It's a six-cylinder.  You can say it's a six-cylinder.  It's not a big block.  Yeah, it's not a big block.  That's a whole different engine, right?  If you have a big block in there,  maybe that is worth the above markup  and why you guys have such a crazy fee on it,  but like, it's a six-cylinder.  I mean, again, I want it and I like it,  but it's not a big block.\n",
            "[00:07:11.879 - 00:07:25.080] SPEAKER_07:  Well, what I meant is a big V6, you know,  that's what I meant.  So, you know, my price is $48,720,  and I'm assuming, like I said,  I'm not the only Nissan you're calling, right?  So, I mean, what's the best?  If you have a better price than my In-N-S-L price already,  let's just exclude me.\n",
            "[00:07:25.080 - 00:07:32.720] SPEAKER_05:  Of MSRP, you're the worst price of the day,  but I've only called one other dealership,  so it's not like I've called a lot of dealerships.  $1,000 off MSRP plus rebate.\n",
            "[00:07:32.720 - 00:07:35.680] SPEAKER_07:  Okay, and then that's what they offer you,  same as mine, basically, almost, right?\n",
            "[00:07:35.680 - 00:07:46.400] SPEAKER_05:  No, incorrect, because you guys have  through a little over almost three grand of rebates,  or $2,500 of ads.  You're offering $1,000,  and then you're adding $2,500 back,  and the idea that every dealership is doing that  is not correct.\n",
            "[00:07:46.400 - 00:07:50.040] SPEAKER_07:  So, did that dealership also have these thing on,  or you're saying that they didn't have these thing on?\n",
            "[00:07:50.040 - 00:07:51.720] SPEAKER_05:  Nope, surprisingly, not every dealership does it.\n",
            "[00:07:51.720 - 00:07:57.160] SPEAKER_07:  So, okay, as long as they're being transparent with you,  they're not gonna do the bait and switch,  when you go there and drive in.\n",
            "[00:07:57.160 - 00:08:03.759] SPEAKER_05:  No, you're just incorrect by saying  that all dealerships do it.  do and you know in California it's more common than others but not every dealership does it.\n",
            "[00:08:03.759 - 00:08:43.200] SPEAKER_07:  So let me do this for you you know I can go ahead and talk to my boss assuming the price and  everything works out you are going to drive out and drive it back to your home and it's not going  to be something shipped out of state to you right? Yeah I mean I'm more than willing to drive it if  it makes sense yeah absolutely if the deal makes sense. And uh Tommy right is that what you said?  Correct. Okay Tommy give me about 15-30 minutes hopefully I have something you know better number  for you than than the 48, 720 plus excluding some of those hard add-ons okay? Thank you so much I  appreciate it. All right man take care I'll text you right now with my number that way when I come  back with the number it'll be more accurate with the tax rate right? All right sounds good. Okay  one moment here just let me text before weighing up so you know you got my number and I can go  ahead and work for you. All right sounds good. Good talking to you Tommy take care. Good talking to\n",
            "[00:08:43.200 - 00:09:03.520] SPEAKER_05:  you bye. We just don't have to like lie right? Like it's like super simple if you have ads own  your ads this is like the problem and it's like the from but it's like the gaslighting of like  hey this is it's so fool I get so mad because it's this gaslighting right it's the idea where  I'm like oh what's the price online can you guys give me the I'm looking for a good pricing well\n",
            "[00:09:03.520 - 00:09:09.680] SPEAKER_01:  the pricing online is pretty transparent right there it's on there so so 48, 720. Um so are there\n",
            "[00:09:09.680 - 00:09:15.599] SPEAKER_02:  ads? Oh yeah of course there's ads every dealership does that like what are we doing every dealership\n",
            "[00:09:15.599 - 00:10:54.759] SPEAKER_05:  does it so why would I bring and I would have brought it I promise you I would have brought  it up later just like the Honda guy it was a joke I promise it was a joke it was a joke it's a Nissan  it's a Nissan oh my it's a neat and I'm sorry I don't care who you think you are the pro 4x is  not a magically crazy car that nobody can get if you guys don't know who I am hi nice to meet you  my name is Tommy I negotiate car deals for a living my goal is to save you time energy and  anxiety we save you money but that's a byproduct I charge a flat fee of a thousand bucks I handle  everything for you the price of the car the trade the add-ons the accessories you sit back relax I  do everything I don't advertise this as a money saving service because guess what I'm going to  give some truth to you some knowledge to you some information in your noggin you didn't know you can  do this yourself you don't need to hire me I don't  I don't got a magic wand.

It's not a crazy far distance.  I'm one state over.  Like I even like looked it up,  cause I'm like, did I make a mistake?  As soon as an MSRP of 52,000.

Okay, so as of right now we are looking for his number one color his number one color is a little bit harder to get  So I'm looking all around the nation for it  So one of the things that a lot of clients just don't do is look like nationwide for a car like that can help out  A ton so some markets cars can be more or easier to get than others  So that's always step one for us is always look and see can we find it in a better market elsewhere?  And this is like part of the advantage of using delivered right like now everybody wants to go nationwide to find a car\n",
            "[00:14:26.079 - 00:14:36.479] SPEAKER_04:  Hi, Tommy. It's Karl. Oh, I just realized that you sent me a text message while I was dialing you I apologize  Oh, I was calling to make sure you got the numbers and see what questions you had on the on the numbers\n",

            "[00:14:43.720 - 00:14:55.400] SPEAKER_04:  If you choose standard financing or to provide your own financing, there's a $2,500 rebate that's available  If you add that I'm way over $5,000 and concessions. Yeah, I'm looking at a 1.9. I appreciate it\n",
            "[00:14:55.400 - 00:15:02.959] SPEAKER_05:  I know I know it's a steep deal. I appreciate that. I've been looking around  I think I can find it, but I prefer to do it with you guys as you guys know six-hour drive\n",
            "[00:15:02.959 - 00:15:17.680] SPEAKER_04:  So it's a fair request  I'll be more than happy to take your offer to the executive manager, but I personally can't say 5,000 off  How close to the?  3637 that I'm off. Can we agree to or is it 5,000 or nothing? I mean, I'd like to be a 5k\n",
            "[00:15:18.199 - 00:15:22.480] SPEAKER_05:  You know ideally that's where I want to be at if you gave me forty eight hundred dollars off\n",
            "[00:15:22.480 - 00:15:37.199] SPEAKER_04:  You know, I twist my elbow call today. Okay. Well, I like I said, I'll definitely take that to my em  And you had mentioned earlier on the phone that this is something we could probably do today  But that was before I found out you're what I have to FedEx the information out or would you drive out here?\n",
            "[00:15:37.639 - 00:15:58.120] SPEAKER_05:  To set up shipment. What were your plans on the logistics? Yes for me my business partner realistically we could ship it  We could do FedEx if you guys have a sign never makes the most sense. We can figure that out  I mean, what I couldn't get the ball rolling put the deposit down whatever needs to make you feel like you're more serious and all  That fun stuff, but we'll figure out the logistics. I mean we could technically drive but that might be a little bit crazy\n",
            "[00:15:58.319 - 00:16:04.559] SPEAKER_04:  Okay, and Tommy just so  Want to make sure that we know that we're on the right truck. You know, this is a long bed Pro 4x, correct?\n",
            "[00:16:04.559 - 00:16:08.640] SPEAKER_05:  I do I do I do know it's a long bed. I appreciate it. I appreciate you double-checking. Yeah, no worries\n",

            "[00:21:03.200 - 00:21:19.959] SPEAKER_09:  I mean the thing is this the only truck is the only Frontier Pro 4x long bed with both the  Convenience package and the premium package. There's not another one in the state  So, I mean we're willing to we're willing to discount some money, but we're not gonna discount  4,000 or 5,000. Yeah, I appreciate it\n",
            "[00:21:19.959 - 00:21:25.639] SPEAKER_05:  But I mean part of it is is that it's a long bed and not everybody's looking for a long bed  And it's not like Nissan's making a million of these cars, you know\n",
            "[00:21:25.639 - 00:21:38.000] SPEAKER_09:  Oh, oh, no, they're not but I mean it's with it being the only one in the state  I mean, there's not I mean it we're not gonna discount four thousand five thousand dollars on a vehicle  That's the only one in the state and we got a unicorn here, you know, I mean there's other colors, right?\n",
            "[00:21:38.000 - 00:22:17.719] SPEAKER_05:  You're right. There's no other colors of this one in the state, but there's three other cars  I would take and there's others in other states around you  It's not it's not a unicorn just because it's I am if I look at Frontiers as a whole you guys have 50 on your  Lot, right?  It's a long bed like not everybody's looking for a long bed Frontier most people buy a Frontier because it's a small truck idea  The long bed is not as died. Nissan doesn't make as many it doesn't mean I'm gonna pay more for it  It's also 20  Yes.  It is a 1026.  I just haven't made a lot of them yet.  I mean, you guys, if you guys want to hold on to it and maybe somebody's willing to pay  crazy price for it, but I have a feeling in a week or two, you guys would call me back  anyway and I've bought a car from somebody else and we're back to square one and you  guys are like, dang, Nissan's, the market's rough.\n",
            "[00:22:17.719 - 00:22:19.639] SPEAKER_09:  Well, I mean, you said you have other offers, right?\n",

            "[00:22:24.920 - 00:22:26.920] SPEAKER_09:  And then is it the same?  Is it a different color?\n",
            "[00:22:26.920 - 00:22:40.759] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah.  No, it's the same color.  This one is a tactical green and they are at $3,700 off MSRP.  Let me pull it over here.  And where's this one at?  Uh, this one is in, uh, California, uh, 36, 37 off.\n",
            "[00:22:40.759 - 00:22:47.040] SPEAKER_09:  So then are you going to pay to get the vehicle delivered?  Yeah.  See, I mean, whatever you're saving there, you're going to spend on, on delivery.\n",
            "[00:22:47.040 - 00:22:51.959] SPEAKER_05:  So it's like, well, I mean, if they get me to 5k off now, I mean, shipping is going to  be like 500 bucks.\n",
            "[00:22:51.959 - 00:23:00.240] SPEAKER_09:  Well, I mean, if you do, I mean, look, if you have a written offer, I mean, if you can  get that over to me, then maybe I can do something a little bit for more for you.\n",
            "[00:23:00.240 - 00:23:02.240] SPEAKER_05:  Sure.  You're already texted.\n",
            "[00:23:02.240 - 00:23:12.360] SPEAKER_09:  Yeah.  You text, text it.  Cause I'm calling you off like the landline, which is a landline, so I can't get text messages  there.  Uh, are you able to, I'll give you my personal number.  You can text it to me there.\n",
            "[00:23:12.360 - 00:23:30.080] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah.  That's, um, yeah.  If you want to give me your personal number on the world.  My system just crashed.  Uh, I guess I'll call the guy back.  I don't know.  I don't remember his name.  I honestly thought this was the San Francisco dealership.  This is Tom.\n",
            "[00:23:30.080 - 00:23:32.080] SPEAKER_06:  Hey Tom, it's Gavin at Nissan.  How are you?\n",
            "[00:23:32.080 - 00:23:33.080] SPEAKER_05:  Hey man.\n",
            "[00:23:33.080 - 00:23:35.080] SPEAKER_06:  How's it going?  Good.\n",
            "[00:23:35.080 - 00:23:40.080] SPEAKER_05:  Good.  Hey, did you get that video I sent over of the truck?  I did.  It looks great.  And nobody's driven it.\n",
            "[00:23:40.080 - 00:23:57.440] SPEAKER_06:  This is the dream in the driveway.  If I've ever seen one, you know?  So, I mean, you know, anything that we have online advertised with pricing is what we'll  is what we'll do.  There are some, I'm pulling it up right now.  Typically Nissan doesn't do special financing and all the discounts.  That's usually one or the other, whichever you prefer.  So it looks like the online price is $46,828.  Is that the one you saw?\n",
            "[00:23:57.440 - 00:23:58.440] SPEAKER_05:  That is the one I saw.\n",
            "[00:23:58.440 - 00:24:00.440] SPEAKER_06:  Okay, cool.  So yeah.\n",
            "[00:24:00.440 - 00:24:00.440] UNKNOWN: \n",
            "[00:24:00.000 - 00:24:24.559] SPEAKER_06:  So the window sticker on this starts at $52,495.  We usually ask like a couple over,  but the window sticker is usually 52, it's $52,495.  So you will get that discount, 3,116 bucks.  I think there is special financing for 1.9 on these things.  I'll get the term.  So if you do that, we won't get the 2,500 cash,  but you'll be making that up in money you save  on the principal anyway.\n",
            "[00:24:24.559 - 00:24:29.280] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, yeah, and I appreciate that.  Do you guys have any dealer add-ons  or fees or anything crazy?\n",
            "[00:24:29.479 - 00:25:15.720] SPEAKER_06:  I actually just did another one of these  over the phone with a customer.  The dock fees, lender fees,  depends on the price of the car.  So this will be a good estimate.  He put $5,000, so let's say if you put five grand down,  sales tax would be around $3,500,  between 3,500 and 3,600 bucks.  Documentary fee is probably gonna be  somewhere like in the low 400s, maybe 420, $430.  And then the $289 is the VTR,  the vehicle theft registration.  It's those little metal stickers  that you see inside of the door frames on cars.  And what that does is it gives you  a little bit of an insurance break.  Insurance likes having those on there.  Basically, if something happens to your vehicle,  heaven forbid, even if it then gets compromised,  it can be traced back to you as an owner.  And in the event of a total loss,  it covers you up to 2,500 bucks.  But at $289, yeah, nothing else really is gonna be there.  I mean, if you wanna do gap insurance,  we can show you what that looks like.\n",
            "[00:25:15.720 - 00:25:19.639] SPEAKER_05:  So you guys' dock insurance,  or your dock fee scales with the price of the car?\n",
            "[00:25:19.639 - 00:25:21.279] SPEAKER_06:  I need to check on that.\n",
            "[00:25:21.279 - 00:25:24.360] SPEAKER_05:  That's a novel concept I've never heard before.\n",
            "[00:25:24.360 - 00:25:38.480] SPEAKER_06:  Well, I've seen it, to be honest,  I've seen it come back a little bit lower.  So that's why I wanted to check.  Normally, I mean, this one here was 423 bucks,  but this is a different car.  But I mean, other than that, I mean,  we're looking at hundreds in the terms of just little fees.\n",
            "[00:25:38.480 - 00:25:54.080] SPEAKER_05:  Well, I appreciate your transparency,  the $300 ad or whatever, that's whatever.  I do have a deal already for a bigger discount, though,  without that dock fee at $3,600 with an $85 dock fee.  So it's almost like a thousand dollar better deal  than your dealership right now.\n",
            "[00:25:54.080 - 00:25:55.319] SPEAKER_06:  What dealership is that?\n",
            "[00:25:55.360 - 00:25:57.440] SPEAKER_05:  It's ****** and ******.\n",
            "[00:25:57.440 - 00:26:01.919] SPEAKER_06:  Okay, I mean, that might just be a California thing.  I don't know about their...  dock fees. What's the selling price on that vehicle?\n",
            "[00:26:02.039 - 00:26:18.079] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, the MSRP is $51,960.  They're down to $48,323.  They're adding an $85 dock fee, a $35 temporary tag fee and an $8.75  tire, battery and VTR.  So the out the door is $48,451.75 plus tax.\n",
            "[00:26:18.159 - 00:26:27.559] SPEAKER_06:  OK. I mean, ours is still is still cheaper.  I mean, it sounds like we have a better deal on that one already.  Before it was cheaper.  Well, you said there's before taxes was $48 something.\n",
            "[00:26:27.600 - 00:26:31.360] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, but that's because you guys are adding the $2,500 thing.  I'm doing 1.9 percent financing.\n",
            "[00:26:31.399 - 00:26:35.439] SPEAKER_06:  Oh, I see. OK, so there's at 1 percent at 1.9 percent.\n",
            "[00:26:35.439 - 00:26:38.799] SPEAKER_05:  It's 48, 48, 3, 2, 3.  Yeah. And they're trying to even save me more.\n",
            "[00:26:38.799 - 00:26:43.040] SPEAKER_06:  So, OK, I mean, we're I mean, we're pretty close to me.  What do we need to do to earn your business?\n",
            "[00:26:43.080 - 00:26:44.720] SPEAKER_05:  I'm trying to be at $4,500 off.\n",

It's going to be on my business partner's name,  but, or maybe both of our,  I'll talk to him about it right now,  but we're going to do it in one of our names.

            "[00:28:51.659 - 00:28:55.959] SPEAKER_06:  Okay.  Between five to 10,  do you want me to structure it with like 7,500 down?  That's in the middle.\n",

            "[00:28:57.619 - 00:29:01.560] SPEAKER_06:  Yeah, you can just do it.  You know, I could probably show you a pencil  with three options, depending on the deal.\n",
            "[00:29:01.560 - 00:29:03.520] SPEAKER_05:  Gavin, I appreciate it.  You got my lucky number working.\n",
            "[00:29:03.520 - 00:29:06.860] SPEAKER_06:  I know, man.  I appreciate it.  And you know, it's my day off, man.  I came in, I got lucky.\n",

            "[00:29:08.720 - 00:29:12.059] SPEAKER_06:  I know, man.  I like your energy.  This is fun.  You know what?\n",
            "[00:29:12.059 - 00:29:14.519] SPEAKER_05:  My mom always said I had good energy,  but my dad, he didn't like it.\n",
            "[00:29:14.519 - 00:29:15.839] SPEAKER_06:  Maybe he was jealous.\n",
            "[00:29:15.839 - 00:29:18.040] SPEAKER_05:  Honestly, I don't like them.  So, let's see what's going on.\n",
            "[00:29:18.040 - 00:29:21.839] SPEAKER_06:  Were you guys gonna want to look  at any type of like warranty on this?\n",
            "[00:29:21.839 - 00:29:26.419] SPEAKER_05:  I mean, it would be in theory.  I mean, it's something we're considering,  but we haven't decided yet.\n",
            "[00:29:26.419 - 00:29:55.040] SPEAKER_06:  Okay.  Well, I'll show you,  I'll show you with an extended warranty  that takes your three year 36,000 bumper to bumper,  basically, which is the wrong term nowadays.  These things don't really have bumpers anymore,  but that's all your computer's electronics.  And that could extend it out  to probably like 72 months or a hundred thousand miles,  whichever.  If you plan on having it for a while,  we recommend it, you know,  with all the computer diagnosing things,  but like after, if you have this thing  for four or five years,  that stuff won't be covered, you know?  And that can be pretty hefty out of pocket stuff.  Would you like me to show you with a warranty?\n",
            "[00:29:55.040 - 00:29:59.480] SPEAKER_05:  Let's just say without for now,  just so we have it,  and then we'll, we're considering it.  But if you want to send me the pricing on it,\n",
            "[00:29:59.480 - 00:30:05.099] SPEAKER_06:  I'll definitely do it.  Yeah, and I am I could I could tell you you know the the coverage in the term just so you can have you have\n",
            "[00:30:05.099 - 00:30:07.099] SPEAKER_05:  That yeah\n",
            "[00:30:07.659 - 00:30:21.700] SPEAKER_06:  Okay, perfect and if you guys put between five to ten thousand  I don't think you'll need yet, but I'll let my manager will know what to do with that. Okay, okay  Sounds good without warranty 1.9 for those six months. Let me get that structured and I'll get your email home\n",
            "[00:30:21.700 - 00:30:26.780] SPEAKER_05:  I don't use email man. It's the devil's work. I can text you and then I got you you yeah\n",
            "[00:30:26.780 - 00:30:34.459] SPEAKER_06:  You can text me back to that that number. I'll just take a photo and send it over there. Okay, just email  No problem\n",
            "[00:30:34.959 - 00:30:40.459] SPEAKER_05:  Do you guys have some background music on over there we do I just heard some like something sound familiar in the background\n",
            "[00:30:40.459 - 00:30:44.560] SPEAKER_06:  Yeah, yeah, we like to like to have a fun vibe around here. We're a fun store. Okay. Yeah\n",
            "[00:30:44.560 - 00:30:53.639] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, fun store fun background fun fun fun streams fun fun fun fun fun cars. Okay. Awesome. Great  Let me get this together\n",
            "[00:30:54.639 - 00:30:59.459] SPEAKER_06:  Yeah, and I'll text it. Thanks so much. You're welcome. I'll be in touch. Okay. Bye\n",
            "[00:31:00.159 - 00:32:21.200] SPEAKER_05:  Yeah, for sure. I was on the back. Gosh, I just want to do it  I think we gotta go to Canada guys. They were gonna go to Canada. I just keep getting recognized  I'm gonna tell my team call call Michael Hunter sub dog. What's going on?  Hey this Frontier Pro 4x took me a little bit longer  But I got a long bed and they're willing to do $4,500 off it and the 1.9  Dang with a long bed in the green that he wants bada-boom bada-bing bada-bing  Can you can you send it to the client? Let him know that I did this live  I want to jump on it ASAP because there's not many of these trucks. This is like a nationwide truck look  Yeah, okay cool cool chill cool cool cool, um, that is all I need  Let me know if there's any issue there  Wait, we got new numbers one second, please hold. Oh, there's other dealerships at  $4,400 off so just you guys know this is how this is what dealerships do, right?  And I think they may be the guy that was watching us live on the Frontier deal  It doesn't matter right, but I want to I want to be very clear. So let's go back to  the frontier deal. So we talked about the frontier deal, the dealership went through and took back  the offer, they went back and took back the offer and said, Nah, we're not giving you the offer  anymore. My manager vetoed it. So we're gonna give it to the other dealership that ended up  giving us $4,400 off with the $85 doc fee. Bada boom bada bitch.\n"
